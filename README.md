# Kenyan Population Analysis
This Python script analyzes the population of Kenya using web scraping and data visualization techniques.

## Data Source
The population data is scraped from the Worldometers website.
Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:

requests: for making HTTP requests to the website
BeautifulSoup: for parsing the HTML content of the website
pandas: for data manipulation and storage
plotly.express: for creating line, bar, and pie charts
plotly.graph_objects: for customizing the chart layout

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas plotly


Run the Python script, and it will automatically generate three types of charts:

- Line chart: Shows the Kenyan population from 1960 to 2024
- Bar chart: Displays the Kenyan population growth over the years
- Pie chart: Illustrates the population distribution for the last 10 years


The charts will be displayed using the Plotly library, and you can interact with them, such as zooming, panning, and viewing hover tooltips.

## Features

Web Scraping: The script uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract the population data from the Worldometers website.
Data Manipulation: The script converts the population data into a Pandas DataFrame and performs some basic data cleaning and sorting.
Data Visualization: The script uses the plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects libraries to create line, bar, and pie charts to visualize the Kenyan population data.
Hover Tooltips: The charts include hover tooltips that display the population values with commas for better readability.

## Future Improvements

Incorporate additional data sources to enrich the analysis (e.g., historical GDP, birth/death rates, etc.)
Add more advanced statistical analysis and forecasting models to predict future population trends
Explore interactive dashboards or web applications to present the analysis in a more user-friendly way

markdownCopy# Kenyan Population Analysis

This Python script analyzes the population of Kenya using web scraping and data visualization techniques.

## Data Source

The population data is scraped from the [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/kenya-population/) website.

## Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:

python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
You can install these dependencies using pip:

- pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas plotly


The script starts by defining the URL to scrape the population data from:

pythonCopyurl = "https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/kenya-population/"

It then sends a GET request to the website and parses the content using BeautifulSoup:

pythonCopyresponse = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

The script locates the table that contains the population data and extracts the rows:

pythonCopytable = soup.find('table', attrs={"class": "table table-striped table-bordered table-hover table-condensed table-list"})
rows = table.find_all('tr')

The data is then processed and stored in a Pandas DataFrame:

pythonCopydata = []
for row in rows[1:]:  # Skip the header row
    cols = row.find_all('td')
    year = int(cols[0].text.strip())
    population = int(cols[1].text.strip().replace(',', ''))
    data.append([year, population])
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Year', 'Population'])
df = df.sort_values(by='Year')

Three types of charts are created using Plotly:

## Line chart:

pythonCopyline_chart = px.line(df, x='Year', y='Population', title='Kenyan Population from 1960 to 2024',
                    labels={'Year': 'Year', 'Population': 'Population'},
                    hover_data={'Population': ':,'})
line_chart.update_traces(marker=dict(size=8, symbol='circle', color='blue'), mode='lines+markers')

## Bar chart:

pythonCopybar_chart = px.bar(df, x='Year', y='Population', title='Kenyan Population Growth (Bar Chart)',
                  labels={'Year': 'Year', 'Population': 'Population'},
                  hover_data={'Population': ':,'}, text='Population')
bar_chart.update_traces(texttemplate='%{text:,}', textposition='outside')

## Pie chart:

pythonCopypie_df = df.tail(10)
pie_chart = px.pie(pie_df, values='Population', names='Year', title='Kenyan Population Distribution (Last 10 Years)',
                  hover_data=['Population'], labels={'Population': 'Population'},
                  hole=0.4)
pie_chart.update_traces(textposition='inside', textinfo='percent+label', marker=dict(line=dict(color='#000000', width=2)))

Finally, the three charts are displayed using the show() method:

pythonCopyline_chart.show()
bar_chart.show()
pie_chart.show()
